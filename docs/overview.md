# Project Overview

## Purpose
Stream Assistant, with its working title, serves a dual purpose. Primarily, it recreates a broadcast television experience, leveraging a curated selection of media from a personal library to evoke nostalgia. Additionally, it addresses decision paralysis by offering mood or genre-based selected content streams.

## Functionality
### Metadata and Database Integration
Stream Assistant seamlessly integrates with a metadata-rich database and employs path routes to access a user's personal digital media library.

### Procedural Stream Construction
The application constructs a streaming experience procedurally, allowing users to define preferences for scheduled time slots or a dynamic combination of both.

### Broadcast Emulation
In addition to on-demand streaming, Stream Assistant emulates a broadcast television model. It follows a structured 30-minute time slot schedule, intelligently allocating shows and movies to specific time blocks. The precision ensures each content piece starts at the hour or half-hour mark.

### Buffer Media
To enhance the broadcast experience, Stream Assistant incorporates 'buffer' media. Comprising commercials, music videos, and shorts, these interstitials are thematically aligned with the adjacent movie or show. The thematic connection is established based on factors such as genre, air date, or a combination of both when applicable.
