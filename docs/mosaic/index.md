# Mosaic

### What is Mosaic?

Mosaic is an innovative project aimed at creating a framework for identifying and categorizing cinematic and musical genres in a way that enhances user experience during streaming. By analyzing both cinematic genres and their corresponding musical signatures, we intend to develop a nuanced understanding of how different genres relate to one another. This interconnectedness will enable the creation of atomic genres—distinct categories that encapsulate specific emotional and thematic tones—while also facilitating fluid transitions between these genres throughout a streaming experience.

### What are Atomic Genres?

An atomic genre represents a distinct and self-contained category that encapsulates a specific combination of emotional tones, thematic elements, and musical signatures. Unlike traditional genres that encompass broader narratives, atomic genres hone in on capturing the essence of particular viewer experiences by distilling them into fundamental components. For instance, (Atomic) Sci-Fi merges imaginative, often futuristic exploration with themes centered around technology, existential inquiries, and the unknown. This synthesis creates a unique emotional landscape, enabling viewers to engage with content that resonates deeply with their expectations and desires. Each atomic genre serves as a foundational element within the larger context of cinematic and musical relationships, facilitating nuanced selections and transitions that enhance storytelling and emotional engagement. By clearly defining these atomic genres, we provide a structured framework for genre identification, ensuring seamless transitions that maintain a cohesive viewing experience. We use the word atomic here to convey a sense of being the smallest part that can be used as a building block to create a 'formula'.

### What are not Atomic Genres?

While atomic genres represent distinct musical or narrative traditions with specific thematic elements, some themes defy this categorization by blending multiple genres. An example of this is Space Opera, a theme that prioritizes grand adventures and heroic journeys set in outer space. Space Opera often borrows themes from Action, Adventure, and Fantasy rather than strictly adhering to the core principles of Science Fiction (as it is commonly associated). The narratives typically focus on epic battles, larger-than-life characters, and fantastical technologies that resemble magic rather than realistic science. This fusion creates a vivid and often whimsical romp through the cosmos, where the hero's journey takes center stage, overshadowing the thematic depth usually associated with traditional science fiction. As a result, Space Opera exemplifies how narratives can transcend their atomic genre roots, delivering entertaining escapades that engage audiences through action and adventure. Thus when associating a piece of media to this theme, it would be labeled as Action-Adventure-Fantasy instead of "Space Opera", this helps create a specific understanding of the contents of the media that is beyond the normal zeitgeist of how media is commonly, and often incorrectly, described.

### Why this is important to Kaleidoscope

By directly defining atomic genres and a piece of media is comprised of tonally and emotively, we better define the vibe associated with it to better select adjacent media that flows better with the theme. Keeping genres to direct atomic definitions creates a commonality that is better defined than using a litany of extremely nuanced 'Subgenres', especially when normal subgenres are commonly associated with the wrong overarching genre (such as the case of Space Opera and Sci-Fi).
