# Classical

Classical music refers to the formal, structured music of Western art tradition, composed over several centuries, from the Baroque period to the Romantic era and beyond. It is characterized by its complexity, dynamic range, and the use of orchestras, chamber ensembles, and solo instruments. Classical music often focuses on themes of emotion, storytelling, and grandeur, using a rich harmonic structure and formal compositions like symphonies, concertos, and operas.

## Key Characteristics:

### Complex Structure:

Classical compositions follow formal structures, such as sonatas, symphonies, and concertos, often with multiple movements.

### Dynamics & Emotion:

Wide dynamic range and use of tempo changes to evoke powerful emotions, often dramatic or grand in scope.

### Melodic & Harmonic Development:

The use of elaborate melodies and harmonic progressions that evolve over the course of a piece.
