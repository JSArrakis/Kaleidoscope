# Stream Assistant

TODO: Template and then format this

Allows you to create playlists of media with your own locally hosted media files and then execute that play list with a local media player on your machine

Allows you to stream via Discord or Plex or other platorm with streaming capabilities.

Without any user defined input, Stream Assistant will create a stream procedurally using the media on your own machine.

Procedural streams by default attempt to ensure show episodes and movies start on the hour or half hour mark of the global clock. It accomplishes this by procedurally selecting and injecting locally hosted commercials, music videos, short videos, and your own promotional videos between episodes and movies.

The procedural stream starts immediately when executed, it assumes that all media in the playlist should play consecutively with no breaks or pauses.

The media selected by the procedural stream can be influenced by users inputting specific genre tags into the stream start request in order to flavor the stream by genre(s) of what the user would want to watch.

The procedural stream by default will play continuously until the end of time or until it is manually stopped. During this time it will populate the stream each day for the entire day, relooping shows from the start or reselecting movies where applicable.

Stream Assistant allows the scheduling of movies and shows to specific time slots in an adhoc manner. It also allows for reoccuring schedules on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly time schedule.

Stream Assistant allows for the creation of programming blocks, which can be movie marathons, music video marathons, show marathons, or mixed programming blocks. These blocks can be set so that the order in which the media appears within them is constant (Such as Cartoon Network's Toonami, or UPN's TGIF). The blocks are also subject to the same scheduling system as shows and movies if desired

Stream Assistant will keep track of the progression of shows based on different stream type executions, and within specific programming blocks respective to their own contexts to keep show episode and movie anthology progressions in order.
